# Jumpsuit 


## The idea behind the example

[Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) is a static site generator for React.

## `withRoot` usage

We are using the `withRoot` higher-order component to accommodate Material-UI's styling solution with Gatsby.

⚠️ You should only use a single `withRoot` for rendering one page.
